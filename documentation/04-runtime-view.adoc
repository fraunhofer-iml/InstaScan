*Contents*

- 1 General Component Communication
- 2 Transaction related schemes and definitions
- 3 Use Cases and process flows

== General Component Communication

All inter-component communication is carried out using JSON messages.
This communication occurs either through direct REST interactions from the frontend to the BFF (backend for frontend), or for inter-service communication, an AMQP messaging queue via a broker instance, as provided by https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ].

== Transaction related schemes and definitions

This Chapter outlines all available APIs in the following Order:

1. The Backend which accepts AMQP messages related to the process.
2. The Api exposed through the BFF which the InstaScan Frontend uses to query for data and upload new documents.

=== AMQP specific messaging interfaces and API

The BFF service uses various AMQP endpoints provided by the storage service and the document-analyzation service. Storage service and document analysis service also communicate with each other via AMQP.

==== Storage Service API
|===
| *Image Controller* | Path | Description
|CREATE | `/images/create` | Create a new image. Is used by the BFF.
|UPDATE | `images/update` | Updates an existing image. Is used by the BFF.
|GET | `images/read` | Returns all existing images. Is used by the BFF.
|GET_BY_ID | `images/read-by-id` | Returns a specific image. Is used by the BFF.
|REMOVE_IMAGE | `images/remove` | Remove a specific image. Is used by the BFF.
|PUBLISH_ANALYSIS | `analysis/publish` | Saves a complete analysis result in the database. Is used by the document analyzation service.
|READ_ANALYSIS | `analysis/get` | Returns an analysis result of a specific image. Is used by the BFF.
|ANALYZE_BUNDLE | `analysis/bundle/create` | Analyze all documents of a certain bundle. Is used by the BFF.
|===

| *Image Subscribe Controller* | Path | Description
|REFRESH_ANALYSIS | `analysis/refresh` | Refresh the analysis result of a specific image. Is used by the BFF.
|===

==== Document Analyzation Service API
|===
| *Image Controller* | Path | Description
|CREATE | `/images/create` | Accepts a new image, prepares it and sends it to an AI service for analysis. Is used by the BFF.
|===

=== REST specific messaging interfaces and API

The BFF serves as a bridge for the frontend and enables RESTful endpoints.
It has a Swagger api that specifies how the individual endpoints are defined. As soon as the BFF service is started, this swagger api is available under http://localhost:3000/api.
